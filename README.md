## What is Jedis?

Jedis is a Java client for [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis "Redis") designed for performance and ease of use.

Are you looking for a high-level library to handle object mapping? See [redis-om-spring](https://github.com/redis/redis-om-spring)!

## Supported Redis versions

The most recent version of this library supports redis version 
[5.0](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/5.0/00-RELEASENOTES), 
[6.0](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/6.0/00-RELEASENOTES), 
[6.2](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/6.2/00-RELEASENOTES), 
[7.0](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.0/00-RELEASENOTES), 
[7.2](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.2/00-RELEASENOTES) and 
[7.4](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/7.4/00-RELEASENOTES).

The table below highlights version compatibility of the most-recent library versions and Redis versions. Compatibility means communication features, and Redis command capabilities.


| Jedis version | Supported Redis versions              | JDK Compatibility |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 3.9+          | 5.0 to 6.2 Family of releases         | 8, 11             |
| >= 4.0        | Version 5.0 to 7.2 Family of releases | 8, 11, 17         |
| >= 5.0        | Version 6.0 to current                | 8, 11, 17, 21     |
| >= 5.2        | Version 7.2 to current                | 8, 11, 17, 21     |

## Getting started

To get started with Jedis, first add it as a dependency in your Java project. If you're using Maven, that looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>redis.clients</groupId>
    <artifactId>jedis</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

To use the cutting-edge Jedis, check [here](/docs/jedis-maven.md).

Next, you'll need to connect to Redis. Consider installing a redis-stack docker:

```bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -it redis/redis-stack:latest
```

For many applications, it's best to use a connection pool. You can instantiate a Jedis connection pool like so:

```java
JedisPool pool = new JedisPool("localhost", 6379);
```

With a `JedisPool` instance, you can use a
[try-with-resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)
block to get a connection and run Redis commands.

Here's how to run a single [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set) command within a *try-with-resources* block:

```java
try (Jedis jedis = pool.getResource()) {
  jedis.set("clientName", "Jedis");
}
```

`Jedis` instances implement most Redis commands. See the
[Jedis Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/redis.clients/jedis/latest/redis/clients/jedis/Jedis.html)
for the complete list of supported commands.

### Easier way of using connection pool

Using a *try-with-resources* block for each command may be cumbersome, so you may consider using JedisPooled.

```java
JedisPooled jedis = new JedisPooled("localhost", 6379);
```

Now you can send commands like sending from Jedis.

```java
jedis.sadd("planets", "Venus");
```

## Connecting to a Redis cluster

Jedis lets you connect to Redis Clusters, supporting the [Redis Cluster Specification](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
To do this, you'll need to connect using `JedisCluster`. See the example below:

```java
Set<HostAndPort> jedisClusterNodes = new HashSet<HostAndPort>();
jedisClusterNodes.add(new HostAndPort("127.0.0.1", 7379));
jedisClusterNodes.add(new HostAndPort("127.0.0.1", 7380));
JedisCluster jedis = new JedisCluster(jedisClusterNodes);
```

Now you can use the `JedisCluster` instance and send commands like you would with a standard pooled connection:

```java
jedis.sadd("planets", "Mars");
```

## Using Redis modules

Jedis includes support for [Redis modules](https://redis.io/docs/modules/) such as
[RedisJSON](https://redis.io/json/) and [RediSearch](https://redis.io/search/).

See the [RedisJSON Jedis](docs/redisjson.md) or [RediSearch Jedis](docs/redisearch.md) for details.

## Failover

Jedis supports retry and failover for your Redis deployments. This is useful when:

1. You have more than one Redis deployment. This might include two independent Redis servers or two or more Redis databases replicated across multiple [active-active Redis Enterprise](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/rs/databases/active-active/) clusters.
2. You want your application to connect to one deployment at a time and to fail over to the next available deployment if the first deployment becomes unavailable.

For the complete failover configuration options and examples, see the [Jedis failover docs](docs/failover.md).

## Documentation

The [Jedis wiki](http://github.com/redis/jedis/wiki) contains several useful articles for using Jedis.

You can also check the [latest Jedis Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/redis.clients/jedis/latest/index.html).

Some specific use-case examples can be found in [`redis.clients.jedis.examples`
package](src/test/java/redis/clients/jedis/examples/) of the test source codes.
