# How to use Jedis Github Issue

* Github issues SHOULD BE USED to report bugs and for DETAILED feature requests. Everything else belongs in the [Jedis Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/jedis_redis) or [Jedis Github Discussions](https://github.com/redis/jedis/discussions).

Please post general questions to Google Groups or Github discussions. These can be closed without response when posted to Github issues.

# How to contribute by Pull Request

1. Fork Jedis repo on github ([how to fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo))
2. Create a topic branch (`git checkout -b my_branch`)
3. Push to your remote branch (`git push origin my_branch`)
4. Create a pull request on github ([how to create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request))

Create a branch with meaningful name, and do not modify the master branch directly.

Please add unit tests to validate your changes work, then ensure your changes pass all unit tests.

# Jedis Test Environment

Jedis unit tests run with the latest [Redis unstable branch](https://github.com/redis/redis/tree/unstable).
Please let them prepared and installed.

Jedis unit tests use many Redis instances, so we use a ```Makefile``` to prepare environment. 

Start unit tests with ```make test```.
Set up test environments with ```make start```, tear down those environments with ```make stop``` and clean up the environment files with ```make cleanup```.


# Jedis Test Environment Using Docker

This guide explains how to bootstrap and manage a test environment for Jedis using Docker Compose.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Start the test environment** by running the following command (examples below).
   - For instance, to start the environment with Redis 8.0-M01, use `make start-test-env`.
2. **Run tests** through your IDE, Maven, or other testing tools as needed.
3. **Stop the test environment** by running the following command:
   - `make stop-test-env`
   - This will stop and tear down the Docker containers running the Redis service

# Start the Test Environment Using Docker

You can bootstrap the test environment for supported versions of Redis using the provided `make` targets.

## Option 1: Using `make` Targets
To bring up the test environment for a specific Redis version (8.0-M01, 7.4.1, 7.2.6, or 6.2.16), use the following command:
```bash
make start-test-env version=8.0-M01  # Replace with desired version
```

## Option 2: Using docker compose commands directly
Docker compose file can be found in `src/test/resources/env` folder.
- **Redis  8.0-M01, 7.4.1, 7.2.6**
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/redis-env-work
export REDIS_VERSION=8.0-M01
docker compose up
```
- **Redis 6.2.16**
- **NOTE:** Redis 6.2.16 uses a dedicated `.env.v6.2.16`.
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/redis-env-work
docker compose --env-file .env.v6.2.16 up
```


# Some rules of Jedis source code

## Code Convention

* Jedis uses HBase Formatter introduced by [HBASE-5961](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-5961)
* You can import code style file (located to hbase-formatter.xml) to Eclipse, IntelliJ
  * line break by column count seems not working with IntelliJ
* <strike>You can run ```make format``` anytime to reformat without IDEs</strike>
* DO NOT format the source codes within `io.redis.examples` test package.
* A test class name MUST NOT end with `Example`.

## Adding commands

* Jedis uses many interfaces to structure commands
  * planned to write documentation about it, contribution is more welcome!
* We need to add commands to all interfaces which have responsibility to expose
  * ex) We need to add ping() command to BasicCommands, and provide implementation to all of classes which implemented BasicCommands

## type <-> byte array conversion

* string <-> byte array : use SafeEncoder.encode()
  * Caution: use String.toBytes() directly will break GBK support!
* boolean, int, long, double -> byte array : use Protocol.toByteArray()

Thanks!
